Demo of API consumption, JSON parsing to native model objects and asynchronous image loading from the flickr search API.

Requires Swift 3 and XCode 8

This demo requires a resources file (.plist) to be added to the root of project directory.

This plist file should be named "APIKey.plist"

Contents: 

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
